        "*   **User Input and Geocoding Successful:** The system successfully prompted the user for their name, starting, and ending destinations. Geocoding of these locations into latitude and longitude coordinates was performed using `geopy.geocoders.Nominatim`, resolving an initial `user_agent` configuration error.\n",
        "*   **Persistent API Key Loading Failure:** Despite multiple attempts and detailed instructions, the `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY` could not be loaded from the `.env` file, preventing the `get_current_weather` function from fetching actual weather data for the specified locations.\n",
        "*   **Data Prepared with Placeholders:** Due to the API key issue, placeholder weather data (e.g., temperature 50.0°F, clear weather, wind speed 10.0 mph) was used to construct the input for the loaded machine learning model. Geocoded latitudes and longitudes were included, or default values if not available or required by the model.\n",
        "*   **Model Prediction Required Preprocessing:** The model prediction initially failed because a categorical feature, 'Sunrise_Sunset' (with string values like 'Day'), was not numerically encoded. This was resolved by mapping 'Day' to 0 and 'Night' to 1.\n",
        "*   **Model Successfully Predicted \"Medium\":** After numerical encoding, the `RandomForestClassifier` successfully processed the prepared data (including placeholder weather) and made a prediction, which was interpreted as \"Medium\".\n",
        "*   **Comprehensive Report Generated:** A user-friendly report was successfully generated, presenting the user's name, geocoded starting and ending locations, a clear acknowledgment of using placeholder weather data, and translating the model's \"Medium\" prediction into the recommendation: \"Proceed with Caution\".\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Resolve API Key Issue:** The absolute highest priority next step is to ensure the `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY` is correctly loaded from the `.env` file. Without live weather data, the driving recommendations are based on static placeholders, limiting the real-world utility of the system.\n",
        "*   **Enhance Model Input Flexibility:** While the framework for integrating user input, geocoding, and model prediction is established, further improvements could involve dynamically handling missing or varied feature sets from the model, rather than relying heavily on generic numerical placeholders, especially for categorical data like 'City'.\n"

        "*   **Persistent API Key Issue:** The `OPENWEATHER_API_KEY` was consistently missing or not found, preventing the `get_current_weather` function from fetching actual weather data. All attempts to load the API key, even after instructions to correct the `.env` file and restart the runtime, were unsuccessful.\n",
        "*   **Placeholder Weather Data Usage:** Due to the API key issue, a placeholder weather dataset was used for model prediction, including values such as Temperature: 50.0°F, Weather Description: Clear, Wind Speed: 10.0 mph, Humidity: 70.0%, and Sunrise/Sunset: Day.\n",
        "*   **Model Input Preparation:** The selected starting city (\"Grand Rapids\") was numerically encoded (e.g., label 5), and the placeholder weather data was successfully structured into a pandas DataFrame (`prepared_data_df`) with all features required by the loaded machine learning model, including the numerical encoding of 'Sunrise\\_Sunset' from 'Day' to 0.\n",
        "*   **Comprehensive Report Generation:** A detailed driving recommendation report was successfully generated, including the user's name, geocoded journey details, a clear statement that placeholder weather data was used, the details of that placeholder data, and a driving recommendation (\"Proceed with Caution\") derived from the model's prediction (implied \"Medium\").\n",

This is essential for the system to fetch real-time weather data and provide more accurate, dynamic driving recommendations rather than relying on static placeholders.\n",
        "*   **Enhance Recommendation Logic:** Once actual weather data is available, the report can be enhanced to provide more nuanced driving advice by integrating real-time conditions directly into the recommendation logic, potentially allowing for different recommendations for the starting and ending locations, or considering the entire route.\n"
